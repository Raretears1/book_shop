          <p>Hello everyone, I'm a beginner programmer.

          The book is the greatest teacher of all mankind. This is a friend who accompanies us from the nursery cradle
          to ripe old age.

          The book that has ended up in our hands can give us a lot. But on condition that we also give her some of our
          attention and time. In relations with the book, the universal law of energy exchange and conservation
          operates.<br> <br> &emsp; Not every book can be useful, but not every reader will be able to benefit from a valuable book. As
          a rule, with our upbringing, maturity, our literary preferences change, and with them their carriers - eternal
          friends - books.

          <h2 style="margin-top:160px;">About my site</h2>
          <p>
          Hello everyone, this is my first site.
            <hr>
          As they said:
          <br>L. Settembrini - A book is man's best friend.
          <br>A.S. Pushkin - Reading is the best teaching!
          <br>D. Diderot - People stop thinking when they stop reading.
          <br>D. Addison - Reading is to the mind what physical exercise is to the body.
          <hr>
          This site was made for people to buy, honor, write reviews of books they liked or didnâ€™t like. many people
          call us bookworms, but this is not so, we are cold-blooded snakes, our mind is poison, our fangs are a sharp
          tongue.
          <br>
